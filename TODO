- There is a bug with macros that have a number only name.  Ideally I come up with a way to fix that, and not prevent number named macros from being made.
- there is a bug with the highlighting on modifiers, sometimes you can end up with multiple modifiers highlighted when you add a new one
- I need to add support for controlling general macros as well, but until then, there is a bug with creating a macro that shares a name with an existing general macro
