arenamacros
===========

WoW Addon - Automatically modifies macros based on various conditions, and adds additional token replacement options as well as expanding the character limit of WoW macros.

Current master branch is functional, but branch v2 is much more elegantly coded (though not quite functional).

Development of this Addon has ceased.
